## React Movies Portfolio Project

In this project I mastered:

* React
* react-create-app
* react-router-dom
* rest-api

All components are in the src folder. All another files was generated by react-create-app

You can run this project locally just do:

clone branch review with git clone https://vdmiler.github.io/react-movies-app or fork it and then clone it from your forked repo
cd react-movies-app
npm install
npm start
