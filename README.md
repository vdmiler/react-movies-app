In this project I mastered:

* React
* react-create-app
* react-router-dom
* rest-api

All components are in the src folder. All another files was generated by react-create-app

You can run this project locally just do:

* clone branch review with git clone https://github.com/vdmiler/react-movies-app.git or fork it and then clone it from your forked repo
* cd react-movies-app
* npm install
* npm start
